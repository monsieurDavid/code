Popular Snake game with Python-Pygame module. **Important:** If you try to run this script without special **png-wav** files it will fail, you have to put following files to a directory with this script. "apple.png","snakehead.png","intro.wav","dead.wav". They are basically apple picture, head of snake, intro sound and dead sound.Without them script will not run. Just make inactive the statements intro.wav and dead.wav, and find a little apple picture and snake head :).Or you can play the game just install it. **Here is the installer:** LINK-REMOVED-BECAUSE-IT-WAS-INVALID
It will install the game in program files, you can find it in search "Flafel" and click to Flafel.exe.
